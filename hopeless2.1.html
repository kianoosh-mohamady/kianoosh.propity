    <p2 class="font1 color section">there is no such a thinng as happieness,most of the time people put the blame on others but the truth is we are the couse of eachother pain,we just enjoy of it however i don't mean all of people i'm just talking about 90% of sucity...in this world if you have feeling's just kill it or it well kill you, there is no such a thing as justice it's only a name with a  beuteafull meaning that some people chase it, fame and glory is nothing,death is the only truth that exiest in this world, and people even made lie for the only truth too!!they want to cheat death and honestly i don't know why people want to live so much i mmean they've done every thing in their power to destroy every livinng creature otherthen themselve and even themsellev's too!!human the only creature that made something to kill eachother,think about it human kind is this there not going to change!if theye woudl've changed,be sure they would do it,beside of that there are some small group  of peoople tat actualy are defreant with the others they try to doo they're best to be a man;to be someone that when they get asleap at night proud of that person ,be proud of who they are.i believe only this kind of people worth the air and to live forever.people who help others,people who choose others first and have the last thinking for themmselve.people who are free... i don't know freedom as a free country or some place without any rule's or ruller,no sir.freedom is a feeling,something that only a few people understand it.it's above every other feeling even what some people  call it love.i mean think about it your'e completly free without any thinnking about anything.</p2>

    </form>
    <section><p1 class="color section font1">to be honest freedom isn't love or make some one laugh freedom dosen't mean to be out in people and not a preson,freedom is a feeling which most people don't know it but it makes you shine ;not shine as star's to others but shine for your'e self and that's the acual dream i think about it sometimes people find happieness in a child or in a man or a women but truth be told my friend freedom well happen to you when you do what you love to do freedom makes people do stuffs that it is immposible .99% of sucity afraid of diying but the dream of freedom made many people to sacrfice their'e life you see!those people are the acual meaning of legend but honstly there are some other that they are alive and doing some real good stuff to make this lost world worth something there are some smart people and they exacly know what people well do for freedom so they use freedom name to make them to do some real bad things and only the real hero's do anything for peopl's freedom and when they erase the heros among people thenn they start the real program and destroy that sucity for theyr'e own benifth. freedom is a feeling where you actualy can feel who you are,how much life is presiose and valuebale and you can do whatever you want to do only if you  want it i think that's the actual power. </p1>
